# pie-studios

Pie studios is a responsive website layout for an E-Commerce company. You can build more complex stuff keeping this as the base. 

The site is only made from raw HTML5, CSS3, JS and JQuery. No frameworks of any kind or tailwind CSS should be used to enhance this project because then the project will loose it's purpose.

The basic tech-stacks are extremely capable and I can assure you that we can build not only a great looking, but also a fully functional website with them.
